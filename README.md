### behind the project
Hi! I'm a book lover with a passion for different genres - from fantasy, historical, contemporary, romance and up to classics, horror, and thrillers.
Hence why I chose to create this CMS project on books. 
This was built during the last 3 weeks of my 2nd college term in my full stack development college program. It taught me a lot in a short period of time.
And I have a lot to improve on. But I see programming as an exciting learning experience. 
Every mistake paves a paths to mastery.
